# FanFictionAPI
A FanFiction API built to use in NodeJS applications.

This NPM package allows you to pull stories from FanFiction as a whole or in pieces at a time.

DISCLAIMER: This package scrapes the stories from the Webpage and can be slow for that reason (especially if the story has a lot of chapters). If fanfiction ever decides to make an API to make it easier. We (or I.) will shift the package to use that instead so you'll be able to use the package
Second Disclaimer: This is my first NPM package so any help or improvements are welcome.
